# Attempt Implementation No Tasks

## PROMPT_TEXT

/sp.implement

## RESPONSE_TEXT

The /sp.implement command was received but cannot execute because no tasks.md file was found. The implementation process requires a tasks.md file that contains the executable tasks organized by phase and user story. This file is typically generated by the /sp.tasks command from spec.md and plan.md files. Without a task breakdown, the system cannot proceed with the implementation workflow.

## OUTCOME

No implementation was performed because the prerequisite tasks.md file does not exist. The system needs a detailed task breakdown to execute the implementation in the correct order with proper dependencies and validation checkpoints.

## EVALUATION

The command was properly received but cannot execute without the prerequisite tasks.md file. The implementation workflow correctly identified that it needs a task breakdown to proceed with the phase-by-phase execution process. The system would need spec.md and plan.md files to generate tasks first using /sp.tasks before attempting implementation.
