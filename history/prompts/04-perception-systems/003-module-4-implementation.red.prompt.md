# Module 4 Implementation: Perception Systems for Robots

## PROMPT_TEXT

Implement Module 4 covering Perception Systems for Robots, including robot camera models (RGB, depth, stereo), LiDAR fundamentals, IMU data and sensor fusion, and building perception pipelines in ROS 2. Create comprehensive educational content with learning objectives, hands-on exercises, verification steps, and interactive elements.

## RESPONSE_TEXT

Module 4 implementation completed with comprehensive educational content covering all aspects of robotic perception systems. The implementation includes:

1. Created introduction to perception systems and their role in robotics with clear learning objectives
2. Developed content for robot camera models (RGB, depth, stereo) with practical examples
3. Implemented LiDAR fundamentals for navigation, mapping, and obstacle detection
4. Created comprehensive content for IMU data processing and sensor fusion techniques
5. Developed perception pipeline content integrating multiple sensor inputs in ROS 2

The implementation follows educational best practices with learning objectives, hands-on exercises, troubleshooting guides, "Try This" experiments, and verification steps. Each section includes interactive elements and practical examples to reinforce concepts.

## OUTCOME

Module 4 successfully implemented with 4 comprehensive chapters covering all aspects of robotic perception systems. The content builds on previous modules and prepares students for advanced topics in subsequent modules. All learning objectives have been translated into executable content with practical examples and clear explanations of complex perception concepts.

## EVALUATION

The module implementation is comprehensive, technically accurate, and appropriately structured for educational purposes. All learning objectives have been implemented with practical examples and clear explanations of complex perception concepts. The content includes hands-on exercises, verification steps, and interactive elements that will enhance student learning.
