# Module 4 Tasks: Perception Systems for Robots

## PROMPT_TEXT

Create comprehensive tasks for Module 4 covering Perception Systems for Robots, including robot camera models (RGB, depth, stereo), LiDAR fundamentals, IMU data and sensor fusion, and building perception pipelines in ROS 2.

## RESPONSE_TEXT

Module 4 tasks have been created with a comprehensive approach covering all aspects of robotic perception systems. The tasks include:

1. Creating introduction to perception systems and their role in robotics
2. Developing content for robot camera models (RGB, depth, stereo) with practical examples
3. Implementing LiDAR fundamentals for navigation, mapping, and obstacle detection
4. Creating content for IMU data processing and sensor fusion techniques
5. Building comprehensive perception pipelines in ROS 2 that integrate multiple sensor inputs

Each task is designed to build on previous modules and prepare students for advanced topics in subsequent modules. Tasks include practical examples, hands-on exercises, and verification steps.

## OUTCOME

Module 4 tasks successfully created with 4 comprehensive chapters covering all aspects of robotic perception systems. The content builds on previous modules and prepares students for advanced topics in subsequent modules. The tasks include practical examples and verification steps.

## EVALUATION

The module tasks are comprehensive, technically accurate, and appropriately structured for educational purposes. All learning objectives have been translated into executable tasks with practical examples and clear explanations of complex perception concepts.
