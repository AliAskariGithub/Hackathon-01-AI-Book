# Module 4 Plan: Perception Systems for Robots

## PROMPT_TEXT

Create comprehensive planning for Module 4 covering Perception Systems for Robots, including robot camera models (RGB, depth, stereo), LiDAR fundamentals, IMU data and sensor fusion, and building perception pipelines in ROS 2.

## RESPONSE_TEXT

Module 4 planning has been completed with a comprehensive approach covering all aspects of robotic perception systems. The plan includes:

1. Introduction to perception systems and their role in robotics
2. Understanding different robot camera models (RGB, depth, stereo) and their applications
3. LiDAR fundamentals for navigation, mapping, and obstacle detection
4. IMU data processing and sensor fusion techniques
5. Building comprehensive perception pipelines in ROS 2 that integrate multiple sensor inputs

The module is structured to build on ROS 2 concepts from Module 1, simulation from Module 2, and digital twin concepts from Module 3. Each chapter includes practical examples, hands-on exercises, and verification steps.

## OUTCOME

Module 4 successfully planned with 4 comprehensive chapters covering all aspects of robotic perception systems. The content builds on previous modules and prepares students for advanced topics in subsequent modules. All learning objectives have been planned with practical examples and clear explanations of complex perception concepts.

## EVALUATION

The module plan is comprehensive, technically accurate, and appropriately structured for educational purposes. All learning objectives have been planned with practical examples and clear explanations of complex perception concepts. The content includes hands-on exercises, verification steps, and interactive elements that will enhance student learning.
