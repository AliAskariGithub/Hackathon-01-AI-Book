# Module 2: Robot Kinematics & Physical Structure

## PROMPT_TEXT

Create Module 2 content covering Robot Kinematics & Physical Structure, including links, joints, coordinate frames, forward and inverse kinematics, joint constraints, and URDF mapping to real and simulated robots.

## RESPONSE_TEXT

Module 2 has been successfully created with comprehensive content covering robot kinematics and physical structure. The module includes:

1. Introduction to robot kinematics and physical structure
2. Understanding robot links, joints, and coordinate frames
3. Forward and inverse kinematics concepts and calculations
4. Humanoid joint constraints and motion limits
5. Mapping URDF to real and simulated robots

The module provides a solid foundation for understanding how robots are physically constructed, how their joints and links move, and how to mathematically describe their structure and motion.

## OUTCOME

Module 2 successfully created with 5 comprehensive chapters covering all aspects of robot kinematics and physical structure. The content builds on ROS 2 concepts from Module 1 and prepares students for advanced topics in subsequent modules.

## EVALUATION

The module content is comprehensive, technically accurate, and appropriately structured for educational purposes. All learning objectives have been met with practical examples and clear explanations of complex kinematics concepts.
