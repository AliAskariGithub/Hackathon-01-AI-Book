# Response

Created comprehensive task list for Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) with:

- 7 setup tasks (T001-T007) for project initialization
- 4 foundational tasks (T008-T010) for blocking prerequisites
- 9 tasks for User Story 1: VLA Fundamentals Learning (T009-T018) - P1 priority
- 11 tasks for User Story 2: Voice-to-Action Implementation (T019-T028) - P2 priority
- 11 tasks for User Story 3: Cognitive Planning & Capstone (T029-T038) - P3 priority
- 7 integration/polish tasks (T039-T045) for cross-cutting concerns
- 6 testing/validation tasks (T046-T051) for quality assurance

All tasks follow the required checklist format with proper IDs, story labels where applicable, and specific file paths. The tasks are organized by user story to enable independent implementation and testing. Parallel execution opportunities are identified for efficient development.
