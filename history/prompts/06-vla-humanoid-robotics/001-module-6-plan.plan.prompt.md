# Module 6 Plan: Vision–Language–Action (VLA)

## PROMPT_TEXT

Create comprehensive planning for Module 6 covering Vision–Language–Action (VLA), including Vision-Language-Action fundamentals, voice-to-action pipelines, LLM-based task planning and cognitive planning, and executing language plans in ROS 2.

## RESPONSE_TEXT

Module 6 planning has been completed with a comprehensive approach covering all aspects of Vision-Language-Action systems for humanoid robots. The plan includes:

1. Introduction to Vision-Language-Action fundamentals and core concepts
2. Understanding voice-to-action pipelines for speech to robotic action translation
3. Implementing LLM-based task planning and cognitive planning techniques
4. Creating content for executing language plans in ROS 2 environment
5. Designing integration of perception, language, and control in cognitive loops

The module is structured to build on AI and robotics concepts from Module 5 and focuses on creating systems that translate natural language instructions into robotic actions. Each chapter includes practical examples, hands-on exercises, and verification steps.

## OUTCOME

Module 6 successfully planned with 4 comprehensive chapters covering all aspects of Vision-Language-Action systems for humanoid robots. The content builds on previous modules and prepares students for advanced topics in human-robot interaction. All learning objectives have been planned with practical examples and clear explanations of complex VLA concepts.

## EVALUATION

The module plan is comprehensive, technically accurate, and appropriately structured for educational purposes. All learning objectives have been planned with practical examples and clear explanations of complex VLA concepts. The content includes hands-on exercises, verification steps, and interactive elements that will enhance student learning.
