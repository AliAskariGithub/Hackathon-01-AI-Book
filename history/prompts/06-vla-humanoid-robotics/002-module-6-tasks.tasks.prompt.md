# Module 6 Tasks: Vision–Language–Action (VLA)

## PROMPT_TEXT

Create comprehensive tasks for Module 6 covering Vision–Language–Action (VLA), including Vision-Language-Action fundamentals, voice-to-action pipelines, LLM-based task planning and cognitive planning, and executing language plans in ROS 2.

## RESPONSE_TEXT

Module 6 tasks have been created with a comprehensive approach covering all aspects of Vision-Language-Action systems for humanoid robots. The tasks include:

1. Creating introduction to Vision-Language-Action fundamentals and core concepts
2. Developing content for voice-to-action pipelines for speech to robotic action translation
3. Implementing LLM-based task planning and cognitive planning techniques
4. Creating content for executing language plans in ROS 2 environment
5. Designing integration exercises for perception, language, and control in cognitive loops

Each task is designed to build on previous modules and prepare students for advanced topics in human-robot interaction. Tasks include practical examples, hands-on exercises, and verification steps.

## OUTCOME

Module 6 tasks successfully created with 4 comprehensive chapters covering all aspects of Vision-Language-Action systems for humanoid robots. The content builds on previous modules and prepares students for advanced topics in human-robot interaction. The tasks include practical examples and verification steps.

## EVALUATION

The module tasks are comprehensive, technically accurate, and appropriately structured for educational purposes. All learning objectives have been translated into executable tasks with practical examples and clear explanations of complex VLA concepts.
