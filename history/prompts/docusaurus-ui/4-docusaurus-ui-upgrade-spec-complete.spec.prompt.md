## Prompt

--title "Docusaurus UI Upgrade Specification Complete" --stage spec --feature "006-docusaurus-ui"

## Response

Successfully completed and validated the Docusaurus UI Upgrade specification. The specification includes three prioritized user stories (P1-P3) with acceptance scenarios, thirteen functional requirements (FR-001 to FR-0013), four key entities, eight measurable success criteria (SC-001 to SC-008), and edge cases covering accessibility and performance considerations. The specification has been validated against all quality criteria and is ready for the next phase.

## Outcome & Impact

Complete Docusaurus UI Upgrade specification created and validated with all required sections: user stories, functional requirements, key entities, and success criteria. The spec is ready for planning or implementation phases.

## Tests Summary

Specification quality validation checklist completed, verifying all mandatory sections, functional requirements, and success criteria are properly defined and measurable.

## Files Summary

- specs/006-docusaurus-ui/spec.md: Complete feature specification
- specs/006-docusaurus-ui/checklists/spec-quality-checklist.md: Validation checklist

## Next Prompts

Ready for /sp.plan (planning phase) or /sp.implement (implementation phase) for the Docusaurus UI Upgrade feature.

## Reflection Note

The specification comprehensively covers the UI upgrade requirements with proper structure and measurable criteria, setting a strong foundation for implementation.

## Evaluation Notes

Failure modes observed: None - specification was created and validated successfully with all required elements present.

Next experiment to improve prompt quality: Consider adding automated validation tools to verify specification completeness before manual checklist validation.
