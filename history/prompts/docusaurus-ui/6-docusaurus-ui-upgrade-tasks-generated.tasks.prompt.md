## Prompt

--title "Docusaurus UI Upgrade Tasks Generated" --stage tasks --feature "006-docusaurus-ui"

## Response

Successfully generated comprehensive implementation tasks for the Docusaurus UI Upgrade feature. Created tasks.md with 53 specific tasks organized across 6 phases: Setup, Foundational, and three user stories (P1-P3) plus polish phase. Tasks follow the required checklist format with proper IDs, story labels, and file paths.

## Outcome & Impact

Complete task breakdown created for Docusaurus UI Upgrade with clear implementation path organized by user stories. The tasks are ready for execution with proper dependencies and parallel execution opportunities identified.

## Tests Summary

Task validation completed ensuring all tasks follow the required checklist format. Dependency analysis confirmed proper execution order and parallel opportunities.

## Files Summary

- specs/006-docusaurus-ui/tasks.md: Complete task breakdown with 53 implementation tasks organized by phase and user story

## Next Prompts

Ready for implementation using /sp.implement or individual task execution for the Docusaurus UI Upgrade feature.

## Reflection Note

The task breakdown successfully organizes the complex UI upgrade into manageable, testable increments aligned with user story priorities.

## Evaluation Notes

Failure modes observed: None - task generation completed successfully with all required formatting and organization.

Next experiment to improve prompt quality: Consider adding automated task dependency validation to ensure all dependencies are properly identified before task completion.
