# Module 2 Tasks: Robot Kinematics & Physical Structure

## PROMPT_TEXT

Create comprehensive tasks for Module 2 covering Robot Kinematics & Physical Structure, including links, joints, coordinate frames, forward and inverse kinematics, joint constraints, and URDF mapping to real and simulated robots.

## RESPONSE_TEXT

Module 2 tasks have been created with a comprehensive approach covering all aspects of robot kinematics and physical structure. The tasks include:

1. Creating introduction to robot kinematics and physical structure fundamentals
2. Developing content for robot links, joints, and coordinate frames
3. Implementing forward and inverse kinematics concepts and calculations
4. Covering humanoid joint constraints and motion limits
5. Creating content for mapping URDF to real and simulated robots

Each task is designed to build on ROS 2 concepts from Module 1 and prepare students for advanced topics in subsequent modules. Tasks include practical examples, hands-on exercises, and verification steps.

## OUTCOME

Module 2 tasks successfully created with 5 comprehensive chapters covering all aspects of robot kinematics and physical structure. The content builds on ROS 2 concepts from Module 1 and prepares students for advanced topics in subsequent modules.

## EVALUATION

The module tasks are comprehensive, technically accurate, and appropriately structured for educational purposes. All learning objectives have been translated into executable tasks with practical examples and clear explanations of complex kinematics concepts.
