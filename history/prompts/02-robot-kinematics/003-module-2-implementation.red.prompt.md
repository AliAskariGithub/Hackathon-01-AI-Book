# Module 2 Implementation: Robot Kinematics & Physical Structure

## PROMPT_TEXT

Implement Module 2 covering Robot Kinematics & Physical Structure, including links, joints, coordinate frames, forward and inverse kinematics, joint constraints, and URDF mapping to real and simulated robots. Create comprehensive educational content with learning objectives, hands-on exercises, verification steps, and interactive elements.

## RESPONSE_TEXT

Module 2 implementation completed with comprehensive educational content covering all aspects of robot kinematics and physical structure. The implementation includes:

1. Created introduction to robot kinematics and physical structure fundamentals with clear learning objectives
2. Developed content for robot links, joints, and coordinate frames with practical examples
3. Implemented forward and inverse kinematics concepts with mathematical foundations and code examples
4. Created comprehensive content for humanoid joint constraints and motion limits with practical implementation
5. Developed URDF mapping content connecting real and simulated robots with hands-on exercises

The implementation follows educational best practices with learning objectives, hands-on exercises, troubleshooting guides, "Try This" experiments, and verification steps. Each section includes interactive elements and practical examples to reinforce concepts.

## OUTCOME

Module 2 successfully implemented with 5 comprehensive chapters covering all aspects of robot kinematics and physical structure. The content builds on ROS 2 concepts from Module 1 and prepares students for advanced topics in subsequent modules. All learning objectives have been translated into executable content with practical examples and clear explanations of complex kinematics concepts.

## EVALUATION

The module implementation is comprehensive, technically accurate, and appropriately structured for educational purposes. All learning objectives have been implemented with practical examples and clear explanations of complex kinematics concepts. The content includes hands-on exercises, verification steps, and interactive elements that will enhance student learning.
