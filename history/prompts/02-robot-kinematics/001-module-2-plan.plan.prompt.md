# Module 2 Plan: Robot Kinematics & Physical Structure

## PROMPT_TEXT

Create comprehensive planning for Module 2 covering Robot Kinematics & Physical Structure, including links, joints, coordinate frames, forward and inverse kinematics, joint constraints, and URDF mapping to real and simulated robots.

## RESPONSE_TEXT

Module 2 planning has been completed with a comprehensive approach covering all aspects of robot kinematics and physical structure. The plan includes:

1. Introduction to robot kinematics and physical structure fundamentals
2. Understanding robot links, joints, and coordinate frames
3. Forward and inverse kinematics concepts and calculations
4. Humanoid joint constraints and motion limits
5. Mapping URDF to real and simulated robots

The module is structured to build on ROS 2 concepts from Module 1 and prepare students for advanced topics in subsequent modules. Each chapter includes practical examples, hands-on exercises, and verification steps.

## OUTCOME

Module 2 successfully planned with 5 comprehensive chapters covering all aspects of robot kinematics and physical structure. The content builds on ROS 2 concepts from Module 1 and prepares students for advanced topics in subsequent modules.

## EVALUATION

The module plan is comprehensive, technically accurate, and appropriately structured for educational purposes. All learning objectives have been planned with practical examples and clear explanations of complex kinematics concepts.
