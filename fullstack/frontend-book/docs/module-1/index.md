# Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System

Welcome to Module 1 of the AI-Spec Driven Book, focusing on robotic middleware for AI/CS students. This module introduces you to the fundamental concepts of robotic middleware, specifically ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2), and how it serves as the "nervous system" for humanoid robot control.

## Overview

In this module, you will learn:
- The purpose and architecture of robotic middleware
- Core communication concepts including nodes, topics, and services
- How to connect AI agents to robot systems
- Practical applications with robot model descriptions

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have:
- Basic programming knowledge
- Familiarity with command-line interfaces
- Understanding of fundamental computer science concepts

## Learning Objectives

After completing this module, you will be able to:
- Explain the role of robotic middleware in humanoid robot control
- Distinguish between different communication patterns in robotics
- Implement basic communication nodes that connect AI agents to robot controllers
- Understand robot model description formats for humanoid robots

## Estimated Duration

This module should take approximately 2-3 hours to complete, depending on your prior experience with robotics concepts.
