## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

<!--
  IMPORTANT: User stories should be PRIORITIZED as user journeys ordered by importance.
  Each user story/journey must be INDEPENDENTLY TESTABLE - meaning if you implement just ONE of them,
  you should still have a viable MVP (Minimum Viable Product) that delivers value.

  Assign priorities (P1, P2, P3, etc.) to each story, where P1 is the most critical.
  Think of each story as a standalone slice of functionality that can be:
  - Developed independently
  - Tested independently
  - Deployed independently
  - Demonstrated to users independently
-->

### User Story 1 - Gazebo Simulation Environment Setup (Priority: P1)

As an AI/CS student with basic robotics experience, I want to learn how to set up and configure Gazebo simulation environments so I can create realistic virtual worlds for robot testing and development.

**Why this priority**: This is foundational knowledge that enables all other learning in the module. Students need to understand how to create and configure simulation environments before exploring physics and sensor modeling.

**Independent Test**: Students can complete the Gazebo setup chapter and demonstrate understanding by creating a basic simulation environment with a robot model and basic world objects.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a student has completed Module 1 and 2 prerequisites, **When** they access the Gazebo simulation environment setup chapter, **Then** they can successfully install and configure Gazebo with a basic world and robot model.

2. **Given** a student following the environment setup instructions, **When** they complete the learning objectives, **Then** they can customize simulation parameters and test basic robot interactions.

### User Story 2 - Physics, Gravity, and Collision Modeling (Priority: P2)

As an AI/CS student, I want to learn how to simulate realistic physics, gravity, and collisions in Gazebo so I can understand how robots behave in realistic physical environments.

**Why this priority**: This builds on the foundational environment setup knowledge and introduces critical physics concepts that are essential for accurate robot simulation and testing.

**Independent Test**: Students can configure and test physics parameters in Gazebo and demonstrate realistic robot behavior with proper gravity, friction, and collision responses.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a simulated robot in Gazebo, **When** students configure physics parameters including gravity and collision properties, **Then** the robot exhibits realistic movement and interaction with the environment.

2. **Given** multiple objects in a Gazebo simulation, **When** students adjust physics parameters, **Then** the objects demonstrate proper collision detection and response behaviors.

### User Story 3 - Sensor Simulation (LiDAR, Depth Cameras, IMUs) (Priority: P3)

As an AI/CS student, I want to learn how to simulate various sensors (LiDAR, Depth Cameras, IMUs) in Gazebo so I can test robot perception and navigation systems in realistic virtual environments.

**Why this priority**: This represents the integration of sensor modeling with physics simulation, enabling comprehensive testing of robot perception capabilities before moving to visualization.

**Independent Test**: Students can implement sensor models in Gazebo and demonstrate that sensor data accurately reflects the simulated environment and robot state.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a robot with LiDAR and camera sensors in Gazebo, **When** students run the simulation, **Then** the sensor data accurately represents the virtual environment and can be used for perception tasks.

2. **Given** an IMU sensor model in the simulation, **When** the robot moves through the environment, **Then** the IMU provides realistic acceleration and orientation data.

### User Story 4 - Unity-Based Visualization and Human-Robot Interaction (Priority: P4)

As an AI/CS student, I want to learn how to use Unity for high-fidelity visualization and human-robot interaction in digital twin scenarios so I can create immersive interfaces for robot operation and monitoring.

**Why this priority**: This provides the visualization and interaction layer that complements the physics and sensor simulation, completing the digital twin concept.

**Independent Test**: Students can create Unity scenes that visualize robot data from Gazebo simulation and implement basic human-robot interaction interfaces.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** robot data from Gazebo simulation, **When** students create Unity visualization, **Then** they can display realistic 3D representations of the robot and environment with synchronized movements.

2. **Given** a Unity-based interface, **When** users interact with the digital twin, **Then** they can control robot behavior and monitor its state in real-time.
