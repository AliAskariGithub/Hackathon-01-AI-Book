## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

<!--
  IMPORTANT: User stories should be PRIORITIZED as user journeys ordered by importance.
  Each user story/journey must be INDEPENDENTLY TESTABLE - meaning if you implement just ONE of them,
  you should still have a viable MVP (Minimum Viable Product) that delivers value.

  Assign priorities (P1, P2, P3, etc.) to each story, where P1 is the most critical.
  Think of each story as a standalone slice of functionality that can be:
  - Developed independently
  - Tested independently
  - Deployed independently
  - Demonstrated to users independently
-->

### User Story 1 - Robot Camera Models (RGB, Depth, Stereo) (Priority: P1)

As an AI/CS student learning about robotic perception, I want to understand different camera models (RGB, depth, stereo) so I can implement computer vision algorithms that help robots see and interpret their environment.

**Why this priority**: This is foundational knowledge for robotic perception - students need to understand how robots capture visual information before learning about sensor fusion or perception pipelines.

**Independent Test**: Students can complete the camera models chapter and demonstrate understanding by configuring different camera types in simulation and analyzing their outputs for various environmental conditions.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a student has completed Module 1 and 2 prerequisites, **When** they access the robot camera models chapter, **Then** they can successfully configure RGB, depth, and stereo cameras in simulation and understand their respective strengths and limitations.

2. **Given** a robot equipped with different camera types, **When** students analyze the camera data, **Then** they can distinguish between RGB, depth, and stereo camera outputs and understand their applications in robotics.

### User Story 2 - LiDAR Fundamentals for Robotics (Priority: P2)

As an AI/CS student, I want to learn LiDAR fundamentals for robotics so I can understand how robots use laser scanning for navigation, mapping, and obstacle detection in various environments.

**Why this priority**: LiDAR is a critical sensor for many robotic applications, especially for navigation and mapping. Understanding its principles builds on camera knowledge and prepares students for sensor fusion concepts.

**Independent Test**: Students can configure LiDAR sensors in simulation and demonstrate understanding of how LiDAR data differs from camera data, with applications in mapping and navigation.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a simulated robot environment, **When** students configure and operate LiDAR sensors, **Then** they can interpret point cloud data and use it for navigation and obstacle detection tasks.

2. **Given** different environmental conditions (indoor, outdoor, cluttered, sparse), **When** students analyze LiDAR performance, **Then** they can identify the advantages and limitations of LiDAR in each scenario.

### User Story 3 - IMU Data and Sensor Fusion (Priority: P3)

As an AI/CS student, I want to learn about IMU data and sensor fusion so I can understand how robots combine multiple sensor inputs to achieve more accurate and robust perception of their state and environment.

**Why this priority**: This represents the integration of multiple sensor types, building on the camera and LiDAR knowledge to create comprehensive perception systems that robots actually use in practice.

**Independent Test**: Students can implement basic sensor fusion techniques combining IMU data with other sensors and demonstrate improved state estimation compared to single-sensor approaches.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a robot with multiple sensors (IMU, camera, LiDAR), **When** students implement sensor fusion algorithms, **Then** they can demonstrate improved accuracy in robot state estimation compared to individual sensors.

2. **Given** sensor failure scenarios, **When** students apply sensor fusion principles, **Then** they can maintain robot perception capabilities by leveraging redundant sensor information.

### User Story 4 - Building Perception Pipelines in ROS 2 (Priority: P4)

As an AI/CS student, I want to learn how to build perception pipelines in ROS 2 so I can create integrated systems that process sensor data for robot decision-making and control.

**Why this priority**: This provides the practical implementation layer that combines all previous knowledge into complete perception systems that can be deployed on real robots.

**Independent Test**: Students can create ROS 2 nodes that process sensor data from multiple sources and output processed information for robot navigation or manipulation tasks.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** multiple sensor inputs in ROS 2, **When** students create perception pipeline nodes, **Then** they can process and integrate sensor data into meaningful robot state information.

2. **Given** a complete perception pipeline, **When** students test it with various environmental conditions, **Then** the robot can successfully perceive and respond to its environment for navigation or manipulation tasks.

### Edge Cases

- What happens when multiple sensors provide conflicting information about the environment?
- How does the system handle sensor failures or degradation in harsh environmental conditions?
- What occurs when sensor fusion algorithms receive data at different frequencies or with varying latencies?
- How does the system respond to dynamic environments with moving objects that may confuse perception algorithms?
