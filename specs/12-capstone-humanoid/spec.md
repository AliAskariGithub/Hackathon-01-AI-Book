- Explain each stage: voice, perception, navigation, manipulation"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Capstone Overview and Task Flow (Priority: P1)

AI/CS students who have completed Modules 1-4 access the Capstone Overview chapter to understand the complete end-to-end autonomous humanoid workflow. They learn about the integration of voice commands, perception, navigation, and manipulation systems to create a complete autonomous task execution pipeline.

**Why this priority**: This is the foundational chapter that introduces students to the capstone project and provides the necessary context for the entire module. Without understanding the overall workflow, students cannot proceed to the more detailed chapters.

**Independent Test**: Students can read the Capstone Overview chapter and demonstrate understanding of the complete end-to-end workflow by explaining the sequence of stages: voice → perception → navigation → manipulation, and how they integrate to form a complete autonomous system.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a student has completed Modules 1-4, **When** they access the Capstone Overview chapter, **Then** they can articulate the overall objectives and task flow of the autonomous humanoid project
2. **Given** a student is reviewing the Capstone Overview, **When** they examine the task flow diagram, **Then** they can identify each stage of the pipeline: voice, perception, navigation, and manipulation

### User Story 2 - Voice and Perception Integration (Priority: P2)

Students access the Voice and Perception Integration chapter to learn how voice commands are processed and integrated with sensor-based environment understanding. They understand how the humanoid robot receives and interprets voice commands while simultaneously building a model of its environment through sensors.

**Why this priority**: This chapter addresses the first two critical stages of the pipeline (voice and perception), which form the foundation for navigation and manipulation. Understanding this integration is essential for building complete autonomous systems.

**Independent Test**: Students can demonstrate knowledge of voice command processing and sensor-based environment understanding by explaining how voice commands trigger perception processes and how sensor data informs decision-making for subsequent navigation and manipulation tasks.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a student has read the Voice and Perception Integration chapter, **When** they encounter a scenario involving voice commands and environmental sensing, **Then** they can explain how these components work together to understand user requests and environmental context

---

### User Story 3 - Navigation and Manipulation (Priority: P3)

Students access the Navigation and Manipulation chapter to learn how path planning and object interaction are executed in the final stages of the autonomous humanoid pipeline. They understand how the system translates voice commands and environmental understanding into physical actions.

**Why this priority**: This chapter completes the end-to-end pipeline by covering the execution phase of autonomous tasks, which is the ultimate goal of the humanoid system described in the capstone project.

**Independent Test**: Students can demonstrate understanding of path planning and object interaction by explaining how navigation decisions are made based on environmental perception and how manipulation tasks are executed to complete autonomous tasks.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a student has completed all capstone module chapters, **When** they analyze an autonomous task execution scenario, **Then** they can trace the complete pipeline from voice command to final manipulation action

### Edge Cases

- What happens when voice commands are ambiguous or unclear in a noisy environment?
- How does the system handle sensor failures or incomplete environmental data during navigation?
- What occurs when the humanoid encounters unexpected obstacles during manipulation tasks?
- How does the system recover from failed navigation or manipulation attempts?
