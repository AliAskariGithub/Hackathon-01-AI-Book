## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Learn NVIDIA Isaac Architecture and Overview (Priority: P1)

As an advanced robotics engineer or AI practitioner, I want to understand the NVIDIA Isaac Sim architecture and components so that I can leverage the platform for high-performance robotic applications. This should provide foundational knowledge before diving into specific applications.

**Why this priority**: This is the foundational knowledge that all other Isaac capabilities build upon. Without understanding the architecture, users cannot effectively utilize the other components.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by completing the chapter content and passing the Quick Test with 80% or higher accuracy, demonstrating comprehension of Isaac Sim's core components and architecture.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a robotics engineer with basic ROS 2 knowledge, **When** they complete the NVIDIA Isaac Sim Overview and Architecture chapter, **Then** they can identify the key components of Isaac Sim and explain how they work together.

2. **Given** a student familiar with perception systems, **When** they study the architecture content, **Then** they can distinguish between Isaac Sim and other simulation platforms.

**Why this priority**: Navigation is the natural next step after perception, and understanding Nav2 integration with Isaac systems is crucial for complete autonomy.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by completing the Nav2 chapter and demonstrating understanding of path planning algorithms and their application to humanoid and mobile robots.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user who understands perception systems, **When** they complete the Nav2 path planning content, **Then** they can conceptualize how to integrate perception and navigation for complete autonomous systems.
