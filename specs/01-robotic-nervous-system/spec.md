## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Robotic Middleware Fundamentals Learning (Priority: P1)

As an AI/CS student new to robotics, I want to understand the purpose and architecture of robotic middleware so I can grasp how it serves as middleware in robotic systems.

**Why this priority**: This foundational knowledge is essential before diving into practical implementation; without understanding middleware's role and architecture, students cannot effectively use it for robot control.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by completing the Robotic Middleware Fundamentals chapter and demonstrating comprehension of middleware concepts, architecture components, and the purpose of middleware in robotics.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a student with basic programming knowledge but no robotics experience, **When** they complete the Robotic Middleware Fundamentals chapter, **Then** they can explain the purpose of middleware and its role as middleware in robotic systems
2. **Given** a student reading about middleware architecture, **When** they study the high-level components, **Then** they can identify and describe the main architectural elements of robotic middleware

### User Story 2 - Core Communication Concepts Mastery (Priority: P2)

As an AI/CS student learning robotic systems, I want to understand communication nodes, topics, and services so I can implement message-based communication between different parts of a robotic system.

**Why this priority**: Understanding communication patterns is fundamental to building distributed robotic applications; without this knowledge, students cannot create systems that coordinate between different components.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by completing the Core Communication Concepts chapter and implementing a simple communication pattern using nodes, topics, or services.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a student learning about robotic communication, **When** they study communication nodes, topics, and services, **Then** they can distinguish between streaming and request/response communication patterns

### User Story 3 - AI Agent Integration (Priority: P3)

As an AI/CS student, I want to connect AI agents to robot systems using appropriate interfaces so I can control humanoid robots through AI decision-making processes.

**Why this priority**: This connects AI knowledge with robotics practice, enabling students to apply their AI skills to real robotic systems, which is the ultimate goal of the module.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by completing the AI Agents and Robot Models chapter and creating a simple node that communicates with a simulated robot.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a student familiar with AI concepts, **When** they implement a communication node, **Then** they can establish communication between their AI agent and a robot controller

### Edge Cases

- What happens when network communication between robotic nodes fails during robot operation?
- How does the system handle different robot model description formats for various humanoid robot models?
- What occurs when message rates exceed the processing capacity of the robot's controllers?
