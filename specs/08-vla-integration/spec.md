## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

<!--
  IMPORTANT: User stories should be PRIORITIZED as user journeys ordered by importance.
  Each user story/journey must be INDEPENDENTLY TESTABLE - meaning if you implement just ONE of them,
  you should still have a viable MVP (Minimum Viable Product) that delivers value.

  Assign priorities (P1, P2, P3, etc.) to each story, where P1 is the most critical.
  Think of each story as a standalone slice of functionality that can be:
  - Developed independently
  - Tested independently
  - Deployed independently
  - Demonstrated to users independently
-->

### User Story 1 - VLA Fundamentals Learning (Priority: P1)

As an AI/CS student with ROS 2 and robotics basics, I want to understand Vision-Language-Action fundamentals and how Large Language Models (LLMs) integrate with robotics systems, so that I can build foundational knowledge for connecting language, vision, and action in humanoid robots.

**Why this priority**: This is the foundational knowledge required for all subsequent learning in the module. Students must understand how LLMs work in robotics context before implementing voice-to-action or cognitive planning.

**Independent Test**: Students can complete the VLA fundamentals chapter and demonstrate understanding of LLMs in robotics through knowledge check questions and basic exercises.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a student with ROS 2 and robotics basics knowledge, **When** they complete the VLA fundamentals chapter, **Then** they can explain how LLMs connect language, vision, and action in humanoid robots
2. **Given** a student studying LLMs in robotics, **When** they review the VLA architecture concepts, **Then** they can identify key components and their interactions

### User Story 2 - Voice-to-Action Implementation (Priority: P2)

As an AI/CS student, I want to implement voice-to-action capabilities using speech recognition (Whisper) and intent generation, so that I can create systems that convert spoken commands into robot actions.

**Why this priority**: This builds on the fundamentals and provides practical implementation skills that students can immediately apply to robot systems.

**Independent Test**: Students can configure speech recognition systems and convert voice commands to robot intents, demonstrating the voice-to-action pipeline.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a humanoid robot with audio input capabilities, **When** a student implements Whisper-based speech recognition, **Then** the system can accurately convert spoken commands to text
2. **Given** recognized speech commands, **When** intent generation is applied, **Then** the system correctly identifies robot action intentions from natural language

---

### User Story 3 - Cognitive Planning & Capstone (Priority: P3)

As an AI/CS student, I want to implement LLM-based task planning that maps natural language to ROS 2 actions, so that I can create intelligent systems that execute complex tasks based on human instructions.

**Why this priority**: This represents the culmination of the module, integrating all previous concepts into a comprehensive cognitive planning system.

**Independent Test**: Students can create a complete system that takes natural language commands and executes complex ROS 2 action sequences through LLM-based planning.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a natural language task description, **When** LLM-based planning is applied, **Then** the system generates an appropriate sequence of ROS 2 actions
2. **Given** a sequence of ROS 2 actions, **When** the system executes them, **Then** the humanoid robot performs the intended task successfully

---

### Edge Cases

- What happens when speech recognition fails due to background noise or unclear pronunciation?
- How does the system handle ambiguous natural language commands that could have multiple interpretations?
- What occurs when the LLM generates an action sequence that conflicts with robot safety constraints?
- How does the system recover when a planned action sequence fails during execution?
